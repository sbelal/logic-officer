# TASK: Generate pull request Message

Let's generate a pull request message for the current branch.

## 1. Get Branch and Diff

Current Branch: !{git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD}

Changed files:
!{git --no-pager diff main...HEAD --name-only}

Branch Diff:
!{git --no-pager diff main...HEAD}

## 2. Generate Pull Request Message

Based on the branch name and the diff, generate a pull request message.
The message should have a title and a description.
The title should be a concise summary of the changes.
The description should explain:
- What was changed and why
- Any important implementation details
- Breaking changes or migration notes (if applicable)

Format the output as a Github pull request message.

## 3. Save the content to file
The filename must be the current branch name (from `!{git branch --show-current}`) followed by `_pr_message.md`.
